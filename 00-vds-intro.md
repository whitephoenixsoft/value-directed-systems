# What Is a Value-Directed System

A **Value-Directed System (VDS)** is an advisory software framework that helps humans and systems **observe, understand, and remain aligned with what they declare to be valuable over time**.

Unlike traditional software systems—which prioritize correctness, automation, optimization, or execution—a VDS prioritizes **care, clarity, and alignment**. It does not act on systems. It does not optimize them. It does not decide for them.

Instead, a VDS makes value *visible*, *auditable*, and *preserved* across change.

A VDS exists to prevent systems from drifting, hardening, or evolving silently away from their original intent.

## Definition

A Value-Directed System:

- Observes systems and services **without assuming intent or correctness**
- Compares observed behavior against **explicitly declared values, goals, or commitments** declared by humans or accountable systems
- Separates **evaluation** (what appears to be happening) from **commitment** (what owners choose to do)
- Records context, rationale, assumptions, and history so meaning is not lost over time
- Preserves ownership and agency at every boundary
- Propagates **intent and alignment signals**, not commands or behavior

A VDS does **not** make changes to the systems it observes.

It makes misalignment, drift, stability, and consequence *legible*—so humans or autonomous owners can decide what to do next.

At its core, a VDS is not a control system.
It is a **caregiving and alignment system**.

## What a VDS Does *Not* Do (Non-Goals)

A Value-Directed System is **not**:

- A task automation engine
- A rules engine or policy enforcer
- A workflow orchestrator
- An optimization framework
- A reasoning system that infers intent
- A system that predicts or guarantees outcomes
- A decision authority or execution engine

A VDS never:

- Acts autonomously
- Enforces behavior across boundaries
- Optimizes without explicit, local commitment
- Reinterprets intent
- Substitutes judgment with metrics

Legitimacy, authority, and action always remain **outside** the VDS.

## Advisory and Non-Intervention Nature

A VDS operates as a **read-only guidance layer** with respect to the systems it observes.

It may:

- Surface divergence between declared values and observed behavior
- Explain historical context and how current states came to be
- Highlight risk, drift, instability, or unmet assumptions
- Share alignment signals across federated systems
- Preserve memory so decisions remain explainable years later

It may **never**:

- Apply changes
- Enforce updates
- Override ownership
- Push decisions downstream

Any change to a system occurs **only when the system’s owner explicitly commits to it**, using their own tools, authority, and processes.

## A New Genre of System

A Value-Directed System is best understood as a new layer in software architecture:

- Like logging, it observes without intervening
- Like auditing, it preserves traceability
- Like caregiving, it reports with care, context, and dignity
- Like alignment, it keeps purpose coherent across time and scale

But unlike any of these alone, a VDS treats **value itself as a first-class, preserved artifact**.

## In One Sentence

A Value-Directed System helps systems change **only when they mean to**—and helps them remember **why**.

It does not control systems.
It helps them care.
