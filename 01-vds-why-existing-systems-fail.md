# Why Existing Systems Fail at Value

Most software systems are designed for correctness, efficiency, or task completion, but they **struggle to preserve or act on value explicitly**. Even well-intentioned systems often fail to maintain alignment with what is truly valuable because they lack a framework for deliberate, auditable decision-making.

## Metrics Drift

- Systems measure success using quantitative proxies (e.g., KPIs, performance counters, analytics).
- These metrics may drift from the actual value they are meant to represent.
- Optimizing for a metric can create unintended side effects that reduce real value.
- Without explicit human or system guidance, the system can pursue goals misaligned with context or higher-level objectives.

---

## Silent Optimization

- Automated systems often make changes to improve efficiency or reduce risk without explicit oversight.
- These silent optimizations may bypass the human understanding of trade-offs.
- Even beneficial changes can inadvertently misalign the system with broader goals.
- Lack of traceable rationale makes it difficult to audit why a change was enacted or reversed.

## Missing Ownership

- Systems frequently act without clear accountability for decisions.
- Actions are executed automatically, with no explicit commitment from humans or governing subsystems.
- Without ownership, decisions cannot be audited, justified, or corrected in context.
- Misalignment accumulates over time, reducing the system’s ability to act in line with actual value.

**Conclusion**

Without explicit decision mechanisms, auditability, and human or system ownership, conventional software **cannot reliably optimize for real value**. Value-directed systems aim to solve this gap by making decisions explicit, auditable, and aligned with overarching goals.
