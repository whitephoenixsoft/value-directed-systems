# Value-Directed Systems — Federation & Autonomy

> **A framework for advisory guidance across autonomous systems.**

## Purpose

This document captures the high-level principles of how Value-Directed Systems (VDS) operate across multiple systems or services without enforcing changes directly. It formalizes ownership, propagation, and observation rules to preserve autonomy, clarity, and accountability.

---

## 1. Non-Intervention Principle

- VDS **never directly modifies the systems it observes**.  
- Its outputs are advisory, auditable, and traceable.  
- The only changes made by a VDS are **propagation of decisions and intent across layers and areas**.

**Analogy:**  
Just as logging records what happened without changing it, a VDS records guidance, alignment, and intent — forming a new genre of “caregiving logs” that also observe value and alignment.

---

## 2. Ownership & Boundaries

- Each system or service has a **clear ownership boundary**.  
- Local systems retain **autonomy**, meaning they can act independently within their declared domain.  
- Federated propagation only **shares intent**, never enforces behavior across boundaries.  

**Rationale:**  
This prevents structural control or tyranny and allows multiple autonomous systems to work together like coordinated farms, without losing local agency.

---

## 3. Federated Coordination

- Alignment signals may propagate across systems.  
- Clinical or caregiving signals remain **local and contextual**.  
- Misalignment tracking is allowed to indicate **intent discrepancies**, but enforcement is never automatic.  
- Experiments or staged changes must respect **local ownership and federation boundaries**.

---

## 4. Observability & Care

- Systems are continuously **observed against declared goals**.  
- Divergences or drift are reported clearly and carefully.  
- Observations are actionable guidance, but humans or local processes decide interventions.  

**Key Principle:**  
Caregiving focuses on **health, context, and value**, not coercion or optimization.

---

## 5. Experiments & Staged Updates

- Experiments should be **limited to a single decision per scope at a time**.  
- Only local systems execute the experiment; federated systems **observe and record**.  
- Staged deployments and delayed acceptance are advisory until local authority explicitly commits.

---

## 6. Summary

Value-Directed Systems in a federated context:

- Propagate **intent, not behavior**  
- Respect **local autonomy and ownership**  
- Provide **caregiving-style observation and guidance**  
- Ensure **traceable and auditable decision-making**  
- Enable safe, staged experimentation without coercion  

**Core Idea:**  
A VDS is a guidance framework — a new layer of advisory logging and caregiving — that preserves human or local control while aligning distributed systems toward shared value.
