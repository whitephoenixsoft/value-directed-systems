# Federation, Autonomy, and Boundaries

> **A foundation for sharing intent and alignment across autonomous systems  
without control, coercion, or collapse of identity.**

This document defines how Value-Directed Systems (VDS) and Value Lineage Systems (VLS) federate.
It formalizes **what federation means**, **what it does not mean**, and **how boundaries preserve legitimacy** across systems, organizations, and time.

Federation here is not an implementation detail.
It is a structural commitment to autonomy, care, and clarity.

---

## 1. Purpose of Federation

Federation exists to enable **shared understanding without shared control**.

Its purpose is to allow independent systems or identities to:
- Share declared intent
- Surface alignment or misalignment
- Preserve history and context
- Coordinate meaning without enforcing behavior

Federation is **advisory**, **non-interventionist**, and **explicitly bounded**.

A federated system does not ask:
> “What should others do?”

It asks:
> “What do others say they intend, and how does that relate to us?”

## 2. Federation Is a Graph, Not a Hierarchy

Federation is **graph-based**, not hierarchical.

- There is no inherent root
- There is no natural upstream or downstream
- Any notion of centrality is a **human decision**, not a system property

Each node in the federation:
- Maintains its own reality
- Preserves its own authority
- Shares information voluntarily

**Analogy**
Federation behaves like distributed version control:
- Histories can be shared
- Context can be compared
- Divergence is allowed
- Convergence is intentional

Federation synchronizes **meaning**, not state.

---

## 3. Autonomy and Boundary Integrity

Every federated participant is autonomous.

This means:
- Each system or identity owns its decisions
- Each boundary defines scope and responsibility
- No external system can compel change

Federation must never:
- Override local authority
- Implicitly enforce alignment
- Collapse multiple identities into one
- Treat visibility as obligation

**Invariant**
> Visibility does not imply consent.  
> Awareness does not imply authority.

Boundaries are not obstacles.
They are the mechanism by which legitimacy is preserved.

## 4. Layered Federation: VDS and VLS

Federation operates differently at different layers.

### VDS Federation (Care and Alignment)

VDS federation concerns **behavior relative to declared value**.

It may:
- Share alignment or misalignment signals
- Escalate persistent deprecation
- Request decision updates
- Request treatment plans (structured experimentation or adjustment)

It does not:
- Share raw telemetry
- Summarize identity
- Enforce resolution

VDS federation answers:
> “This system is no longer serving its declared value.”

Silence is acceptable.
Persistent misalignment is not hidden.

---

### VLS Federation (Identity and Continuity)

VLS federation concerns **identity, scope, and mission coherence**.

It may:
- Share identity-level intent
- Track scope gain or loss
- Represent deprecated or abandoned identities
- Preserve lineage across divergence

It uses:
- Baseline review semantics
- No assumed trust
- Explicit synchronization

VLS federation answers:
> “This identity no longer coheres with the declared mission.”

VLS does not care about health or metrics.
It cares about **who the system is becoming**.

---

## 5. Areas, Scope, and Identity

Decision ledgers use areas differently at each layer.

- **Decision Ledger (foundational)**  
  One area per unrelated decision set.

- **VDS Caretaker**  
  At least one area per monitored value or concern.

- **VDS Federation**  
  Areas per aligned concern, plus a mandatory mission or intent area.

- **VLS Federation**  
  One area per identity, plus a mission intent area for cohesion.

**Invariant**
> One identity corresponds to one domain of authority.

Identity without scope is undefined.
Scope change is an identity-level event.

---

## 6. Escalation Without Control

Federation escalates **clarity**, not urgency.

- Silence is a valid state
- Observation does not demand action
- Escalation is descriptive, not prescriptive

Examples of escalation:
- Long-running deprecated work
- Persistent misalignment with declared value
- Identity pressure caused by scope change

No escalation implies:
- Mandate
- Blame
- Required intervention

Escalation exists to prevent silent drift, not to force resolution.

---

## 7. What Federation Never Does

Federation never:
- Pushes changes
- Applies decisions
- Aggregates telemetry into authority
- Resolves conflicts automatically
- Assumes shared purpose
- Rewrites intent

Federation preserves disagreement.
Legitimacy requires consent.

---

## 8. A New Federation Archetype

This is not:
- Service federation
- Control-plane federation
- Policy enforcement
- Organizational hierarchy

This is **meaning federation**.

It exists so systems can:
- Share intent without surrendering autonomy
- Disagree without fragmentation
- Change without erasing history
- Coordinate without coercion

Federation does not make systems behave the same.
It helps them understand **why they are different**—
and whether that difference is still intended.
