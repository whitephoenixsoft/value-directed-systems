# The Non-Intervention Principle
*Why Value-Directed Systems Never Act*

---

## Overview

Value-Directed Systems (VDS) are advisory, not active.  
They exist to **observe, interpret, and report** on system behavior relative to explicitly declared value — and **never to execute changes, optimizations, or remediations**.  

This principle preserves:

- Human or system ownership of decisions  
- Dignity and psychological safety  
- Auditable, traceable intent and reasoning  
- Separation between insight and action  

---

## Core Assertions

A VDS **must never**:

- Change production systems  
- Apply optimizations or control loops  
- Execute automated remediations  
- Close feedback loops without explicit human authorization  
- Infer or assume intent beyond what is declared  

Any system that does these things is **not a Value-Directed System** — it is a control system.

## The Logging Analogy

Traditional logging answers:  
> “What happened?”

VDS logging answers:  
> “What were we trying to do?”  
> “How did reality respond to that intent?”  
> “What divergences exist, and why?”  

- Like logging: passive, append-only, auditable  
- Unlike logging: semantic, value-aware, intent-relative  
- Unlike a control system: never directly enforces changes  

This creates a **new genre of logging**: interpretive, advisory, and non-coercive.

## Caregiving as a Layer

Caregiving in VDS is **structural**, not behavioral:

- Expressed through **language, framing, and metadata**  
- Urgency or divergence is **communicated**, not enforced  
- Observations are contextual and tied to **declared goals**  
- Provides guidance without prescriptive action  
- Preserves human or system dignity and agency  

Caregiving is **layered between measurement and decision**, not between decision and action.

---

## Layered Model

1. **System Layer:** executes operational behavior  
2. **Measurement Layer:** collects signals and metrics  
3. **VDS Layer:** contextualizes metrics against declared value, detects divergence, advises humans  
4. **Human / Decision Layer:** chooses whether and how to act  

**Invariant:** VDS exists strictly between measurement and decision.  
No layer under VDS can be bypassed to enforce action.

## Boundary Statement

> A system that interprets value *and* applies change is no longer a Value-Directed System.  
> It is a control system.  
> VDS exists precisely to prevent that collapse.  

This boundary ensures the system remains:

- Transparent  
- Auditable  
- Human-centric  
- Advisory, never coercive  

---

## Summary

The Non-Intervention Principle is the defining rule of Value-Directed Systems:

- Observation without action  
- Reporting without coercion  
- Semantic logging and caregiving  
- Clear separation of insight and authority  

It is the foundation that allows VDS to guide, inform, and preserve alignment without ever overriding the agents responsible for decisions.
