# Signals, Requests, and Silence

This document defines how information moves through VDS and VLS without creating authority, urgency, or coercion.

Its purpose is to preserve agency, dignity, and trust.

## Signals

A signal is an observed fact or status.

Signals may indicate:
- Alignment
- Misalignment
- Stability
- Drift
- Deprecation

Signals are descriptive, not prescriptive.

They do not imply action.

---

## Requests

A request is an invitation to deliberate.

VDS may request:
- Decision updates
- Clarification of intent
- Treatment plans
- Experiments
- Identity review

Requests:
- Carry no authority
- Carry no deadline
- Carry no enforcement

They exist to make gaps visible.

---

## Silence

Silence is a valid and meaningful state.

Silence may indicate:
- Stability
- Acceptance of current conditions
- Deferred attention
- Constrained capacity

Silence is not failure.
Silence is not non-compliance.

---

## Escalation Without Control

Escalation means increased visibility, not pressure.

When signals propagate:
- Context is preserved
- Authority does not move
- Urgency is not inferred

Federation amplifies understanding, not force.

## Core Principle

No signal is a command.  
No request is an obligation.  
No silence is an error.

This separation is what allows VDS and VLS to scale without becoming coercive systems.
