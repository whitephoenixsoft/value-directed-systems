# Value-Directed Systems

> **Software that knows what matters — and helps you act on it intentionally.**

Traditional software tracks data, performs tasks, or enforces rules. Value-Directed Systems do something different: they understand **what changes are valuable**, preserve **auditable context**, and guide actions to align with overarching system goals — without ever acting on your behalf.  

Think of it as a guardian for meaningful decisions: observing, advising, and recording, so every action has a traceable reason, every outcome is explicit, and every system component stays aligned with what truly matters.

## What Is a Value-Directed System?

A Value-Directed System is **a framework for integrating software components around a shared understanding of value**. Unlike traditional systems, which focus on automation or correctness, these systems:

- Record human or system decisions explicitly.
- Separate **evaluation** (what we think) from **commitment** (what we actually do).
- Provide **auditability** and traceable history for every decision.
- Operate in a **context-aware, advisory mode**, preserving alignment across individual applications and interconnected systems.
- Respect human or system authority, constraints, and scope without overriding intent.

Charter Core is the foundational engine powering this paradigm. It is minimal, deterministic, and auditable, providing the building blocks for:

- Sessions: explicit, bounded decision-making contexts.
- Candidates: proposals or ideas under evaluation.
- Acceptance: deliberate, traceable commitment.
- Authority & Scope: explicit rules for legitimacy.
- Audit & History: immutable records of all actions and outcomes.

## Usage Example: Individual Systems & Software Integration

Imagine multiple software services in an enterprise — a CRM, billing system, and inventory management tool. Each has its own data, processes, and rules.  

Using a Value-Directed approach:

1. Changes or proposals in any system are **evaluated** first.
2. Value and impact are **explicitly assessed** and recorded.
3. Once all dependencies and constraints are clear, actions are **committed** via a session, producing auditable legitimacy.
4. Systems remain **aligned** with organizational goals, and every decision is traceable and explainable.

Even if humans or machines participate across different layers, the system **never assumes intent** — it only observes, advises, and records. This preserves clarity, reduces ambiguity, and ensures every outcome is defensible.

## Why It Matters

Most software assumes correctness or authority implicitly. Value-Directed Systems explicitly record **why a decision is valuable**, not just what the outcome is.  

This enables:

- **Trustworthy integration:** Systems and applications coordinate without hidden assumptions.  
- **Auditable decision-making:** Every commitment is traceable and explainable.  
- **Alignment to overarching goals:** Individual components act in concert without central enforcement.  
- **Human-centric control:** People remain responsible, while the system provides clarity and context.
