# What Is a Value-Directed System

A **Value-Directed System (VDS)** is a software framework designed to help humans and systems **identify, evaluate, and act on what is valuable** within a given context. Unlike traditional software, which focuses on correctness, automation, or task completion, a VDS prioritizes **explicit, auditable decisions** and maintains alignment with overarching system goals.

## Definition

A Value-Directed System:

- Observes proposals, changes, or candidate actions without assuming intent.
- Separates **evaluation** (what is considered valuable) from **commitment** (what is actually enacted).
- Requires explicit acceptance for any action or change to become legitimate.
- Records all context, rationale, and history for traceability and audit.
- Ensures that decisions at every level — individual components or integrated systems — remain aligned with shared objectives.

In essence, a VDS is a **decision engine with value-awareness**. It doesn’t make decisions on behalf of humans or systems; it makes the value context **visible, auditable, and actionable**.

## Non-Goals

A Value-Directed System is **not**:

- A task automation engine.
- A workflow orchestrator that enforces actions automatically.
- A reasoning engine that interprets intent or predicts outcomes.
- A system that enforces correctness or optimization without explicit human or system approval.
- A decision authority — legitimacy always requires explicit commitment.

## Advisory Nature

The system acts as a **guidance and coordination layer**:

- Surfaces gaps, conflicts, or overlooked dependencies.
- Explains context, rationale, and historical lineage.
- Advises on the consequences of actions or inaction.
- Preserves human or system agency — **it never overrides authority or commits on behalf of others**.

This advisory, read-only approach ensures:

- Transparency: every recommendation is grounded in recorded facts.
- Clarity: the rationale for decisions is explicit.
- Defensibility: actions are auditable and traceable, reducing ambiguity or accidental misalignment.
