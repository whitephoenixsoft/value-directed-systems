# What Is a Value-Directed System

A **Value-Directed System (VDS)** is an advisory software framework that helps humans and systems **observe, understand, and remain aligned with what they declare to be valuable over time**.

Unlike traditional software—which prioritizes correctness, automation, optimization, or execution—a VDS prioritizes **care, clarity, and alignment**. It does **not** act on systems. It does **not** optimize them. It does **not** decide for them.

Instead, a VDS makes value *visible*, *auditable*, and *preserved* across change. It exists to prevent systems from drifting, hardening, or evolving silently away from their original intent.

## Definition

A Value-Directed System:

- Observes systems and services **without assuming intent or correctness**
- Compares observed behavior against **explicitly declared values, goals, or commitments**
- Separates **evaluation** (what appears to be happening) from **commitment** (what owners choose to do)
- Records context, rationale, assumptions, and history so meaning is preserved
- Preserves ownership and agency at every boundary
- Propagates **intent and alignment signals**, not commands or behavior

A VDS does **not** make changes to the systems it observes.  
It surfaces misalignment, drift, stability, and consequences—so humans or autonomous owners can decide what to do next.

## Non-Intervention & Advisory Principles

A Value-Directed System **never**:

- Acts autonomously
- Enforces behavior across boundaries
- Optimizes without explicit, local commitment
- Reinterprets intent
- Substitutes judgment with metrics

Instead, a VDS **advises and guides**:

- Surfaces divergence between declared values and observed behavior
- Explains historical context and current state lineage
- Highlights risk, drift, instability, or unmet assumptions
- Shares alignment signals across federated systems
- Preserves memory so decisions remain explainable over years

All changes occur **only when the system’s owner explicitly commits**, using their own tools, authority, and processes.

## A New Genre of System

A VDS is best understood as a new **layer in software architecture**:

- Like **logging**, it observes without intervening  
- Like **auditing**, it preserves traceability  
- Like **caregiving**, it reports with care, context, and dignity  
- Like **alignment**, it keeps purpose coherent across time and scale  

Unlike any one of these alone, a VDS treats **value itself as a first-class, preserved artifact**, providing an auditable framework for decisions, observations, and intent.

## In One Sentence

A Value-Directed System helps systems change **only when they mean to**—and helps them remember **why**.

It does not control systems—it helps them preserve and act on their intended value.
