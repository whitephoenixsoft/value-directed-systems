# Value-Directed System (VDS) — Concept and Foundation

**Status:** FOUNDATIONAL  
**Depends On:** Decision Ledger, Commit Canon  
**Does Not Define:** legitimacy creation, acceptance, authority, execution, optimization, UI, or server topology

---

## Part 1 — Conceptual Overview

A **Value-Directed System (VDS)** is a **caregiving, advisory system** that helps humans and systems **observe, understand, and remain aligned with explicitly declared decisions and intent over time**.

Unlike traditional software—which prioritizes correctness, automation, optimization, or execution—a VDS prioritizes **care, clarity, and legitimacy**.

A VDS does **not** act on systems.  
It does **not** optimize outcomes.  
It does **not** decide on behalf of humans.

Instead, a VDS makes **value, intent, and ownership visible and auditable across time**, so systems can change deliberately — or remain stable deliberately — without drifting silently or hardening unintentionally.

---

### Definition

A Value-Directed System:

- Observes behavior **without assuming intent, correctness, or obligation**
- Interprets observations only relative to **explicitly declared decisions**
- Issues **check-ins** that describe alignment, drift, capacity change, or uncertainty
- Separates **observation** from **commitment**
- Preserves context, assumptions, rationale, and lineage
- Maintains clear boundaries of ownership and authority
- Propagates **intent- and alignment-level visibility**, not commands
- Embeds **structural compassion**, making care a property of the system rather than a discretionary human trait

A VDS never changes the systems it observes.  
It surfaces conditions so accountable humans can decide **if**, **when**, and **how** to act.

---

### Non-Intervention & Caregiving Principles

A Value-Directed System **never**:

- Acts autonomously
- Enforces behavior or compliance
- Infers consent or urgency
- Reinterprets intent
- Substitutes judgment with metrics
- Optimizes away explicitness

Instead, a VDS provides **caregiving visibility**:

- Describes divergence between declared decisions and observed conditions
- Preserves historical context so present states remain explainable
- Surfaces drift, instability, unmet assumptions, or capacity change
- Issues requests as invitations to deliberate — never as obligations
- Accepts silence as a valid and meaningful outcome

All change occurs **only through explicit human commitment**, using authority and processes outside the VDS.

---

### A Distinct Architectural Layer

A VDS is best understood as a distinct **layer in system architecture**, not a feature of execution:

- Like **logging**, it observes without intervening  
- Like **auditing**, it preserves traceability and memory  
- Like **caregiving**, it reports with restraint, dignity, and context  
- Like **alignment**, it maintains coherence of intent across time and scale  

What makes a VDS different is that it treats **decisions and declared value as the source of meaning**, and treats **care as structural**, not optional.

Metrics, telemetry, and signals have meaning **only** because explicit decisions exist.

---

### Structural Compassion

Structural compassion means:

- Misalignment is treated as information, not failure
- Capacity limits are acknowledged without moralization
- Silence is allowed when nothing meaningful has changed
- Drift is surfaced early, before blame or urgency appear
- Humans remain agents, not targets of optimization

Care is not something users must provide.  
Care is what the system enforces **by design**.

---

### In One Sentence

A Value-Directed System helps systems change **only when they mean to** —  
and helps them remember **why** —  
by preserving alignment, ownership, and truth **with care, clarity, and dignity**.

---

## Part 2 — Foundation Specification (Commit-Centric Behavior)

### Purpose

This section defines the **behavioral contract** of a VDS operating without Charter.

A VDS is a **caregiving system** that observes behavior relative to **explicit decisions** and produces **check-ins** that preserve truth, dignity, and agency over time.

---

### Decisions as Interpretive Anchors

All VDS meaning derives from **explicit decisions** recorded elsewhere (e.g., in a **Decision Ledger**).

A decision provides:

- Scope  
- Intent  
- Bounds or tolerances  
- Assumptions  
- Declared importance  

Without decisions:

- Metrics are uninterpreted  
- Check-ins may exist but remain non-evaluative  

---

### Check-Ins (Caregiving Signals)

A **check-in** is a recorded caregiving observation.

Check-ins may indicate:

- Alignment  
- Drift  
- Capacity reduction  
- Stability  
- Intent unchanged  
- Reassessment requested  
- Paused intentionally  

Check-ins are:

- Descriptive, not prescriptive  
- Non-urgent by default  
- Non-authoritative  
- Append-only commits  

---

### Silence as a Valid State

If decisions exist and no material change is observed, the VDS emits no check-ins.

Silence indicates stability and adequate care.

---

### Escalation and Federation

Escalation means visibility, not pressure.

A VDS may:

- Propagate check-ins  
- Request clarification  

A VDS may **never**:

- Enforce coordination  
- Transfer authority  

---

### Interaction with VLS

- VDS observes behavior  
- VLS preserves intent, identity, and lineage  

A VDS may escalate persistent misalignment or capacity concerns to VLS.

---

### Telemetry, Treatment Plans, and Experiments

- **Telemetry** exists to support care and observation  
- **Treatment plans** are recorded adjustments to how value is measured, not executed  
- **Experiments** contextualize anticipated changes; they do not authorize execution  

All remain descriptive, audit-preserving, and append-only.

---

### Closing Principle

A Value-Directed System behaves like a careful professional:

- Observant  
- Context-aware  
- Explicit  
- Slow to escalate  
- Clear about its limits  

Success is measured not by speed or efficiency, but by **trust, legitimacy, and sustained alignment over time**.
