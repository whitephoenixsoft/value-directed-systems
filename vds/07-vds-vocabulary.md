# Caregiving & Alignment Vocabulary — Reference Guide

> Vocabulary for observing, describing, and communicating system value and intent

This document captures the shared understanding of terminology for value-directed systems (VDS) and value lineage systems (VLS).  
It is intended as a **reference for collaborators** and a **structural guide** to preserve clarity, dignity, and legitimacy in communication.

## 1. Modes of Observation

At any decision or identity scope, the system is conceptually in **one mode**:

### A. Caregiving Mode
- Observes **existing goals or work**  
- Reports **health, stability, and divergence**  
- Preserves context, history, and dignity  
- Language is **clinical, descriptive, non-judgmental**

### B. Alignment Mode
- Observes **intent, purpose, or evolving goals**  
- Reports **misalignment, drift, or changes**  
- Language is **collaborative, reflective, and responsibility-sharing**

**Invariant:**  
A scope may not be in both modes simultaneously.

## 2. Vocabulary Reference

### A. Caregiving / Clinical Vocabulary

**Used when:** Monitoring ongoing goals, systems, or components.

| Term | Meaning / Usage | Example |
|------|----------------|---------|
| **Divergence** | Observed behavior differs from declared bounds | "Observed divergence from the latency target over the past 12 hours." |
| **Decompensation** | System can no longer maintain stability under current conditions | "The service experienced decompensation under sustained load." |
| **Stress Response** | Behavior changes under pressure, may be adaptive | "This pattern appears to be a stress response rather than a defect." |
| **Trend** | Gradual, time-based change | "We are seeing a gradual trend toward increased error rates." |
| **Stability / Instability** | Overall health relative to declared tolerances | "The subsystem remains stable within declared bounds." |
| **Care Recommendation** | Suggests supportive action without obligation | "Additional monitoring may be beneficial given recent variance." |
| **Impact on Goal** | Explains why a signal affects the ability to meet objectives | "This instability may affect the system’s ability to meet the reliability goal." |

**Rule:** Clinical language describes **impact on goals**, not intent or purpose.

### B. Alignment / Coordination Vocabulary

**Used when:** Reviewing, revising, or coordinating intent, goals, or meaning.

| Term                 | Meaning / Usage                                     | Example                                                                         |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Alignment**        | Intent and behavior support each other              | "The system appears aligned with the declared objective."                       |
| **Misalignment**     | Behavior and intent no longer support each other    | "There is a misalignment between current behavior and the stated goal."         |
| **Purpose Drift**    | Gradual erosion of intent over time                 | "We may be experiencing purpose drift as requirements evolve."                  |
| **Unmet Assumption** | A decision relied on conditions that no longer hold | "An underlying assumption about traffic patterns appears unmet."                |
| **Experiment**       | Time-bound, limited evaluation for learning         | "We propose a limited experiment to test an alternative approach."              |
| **Commitment**       | Durable change that updates declared intent         | "This change represents a commitment and updates the system’s declared intent." |
| **Coordination**     | Multiple parts must act together to preserve intent | "This change requires coordination across services."                            |
| **Alignment Signal** | Intent-level information shared externally          | "We are currently prioritizing reliability over throughput."                    |

**Note:** Alignment signals **do not include clinical details, raw metrics, or enforcement rules**.

## 3. Language Boundary Rule

**Principle:**  
- **Caregiving / Clinical:** Describe and report existing goals and system health  
- **Alignment / Collaborative:** Decide, revise, or coordinate goals and intent  

If language feels **coercive, judgmental, or optimization-driven**, the wrong vocabulary is being applied.

## 4. Closing Perspective

Vocabulary is a **structural mechanism**, not cosmetic. Proper usage:

- Prevents silent authority  
- Preserves dignity and agency  
- Enables learning without coercion  
- Sustains trust over time  

Correct vocabulary **shapes system understanding and behavior** as much as code, process, or policy.
