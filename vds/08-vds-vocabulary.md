# Caregiving, Check-Ins, and Alignment Vocabulary — Reference Guide

> Vocabulary for observing, describing, and communicating value, intent, and care without coercion

This document defines shared terminology for **Value-Directed Systems (VDS)** and **Value Lineage Systems (VLS)**.

It exists to preserve:
- clarity of meaning  
- dignity of ownership  
- legitimacy of decisions  
- trust in what is observed and reported  

This is a **reference guide**, not a behavioral prescription.

## 1. Modes of Observation

At any given decision, identity, or area scope, the system operates in **exactly one mode**.

### A. Caregiving Mode
Caregiving mode exists to **care for declared decisions and intent over time**.

It:
- observes existing decisions, goals, or work
- reports health, stability, drift, or capacity change
- preserves context, lineage, and authorship
- uses clinical, descriptive, non-judgmental language

**Primary artifact:** Check-ins

Caregiving mode never:
- revises intent
- assigns blame
- enforces action
- optimizes outcomes

---

### B. Alignment Mode
Alignment mode exists to **deliberate about intent itself**.

It:
- observes purpose, scope, and meaning
- surfaces misalignment or conflict
- supports revision, renegotiation, or recommitment
- uses collaborative, reflective language

Alignment mode never:
- evaluates performance
- reports health metrics
- diagnoses execution quality

---

**Invariant:**  
A scope may not be in caregiving mode and alignment mode at the same time.

Observation and deliberation must remain structurally distinct.

---

## 2. Core Artifact: Check-Ins (Caregiving Term)

A **check-in** is a caregiving artifact.

It is a recorded observation describing how current conditions relate to declared intent and decisions.

Check-ins are:
- voluntary
- descriptive
- non-evaluative
- non-coercive

A check-in answers:
> “What appears to be true right now, relative to what was declared?”

Check-ins do **not** imply:
- action
- urgency
- fault
- correctness

## 3. Vocabulary Reference

### A. Caregiving / Clinical Vocabulary  
*(Used when issuing check-ins)*

| Term | Meaning / Usage | Example |
|-----|------------------|---------|
| **Check-In** | A recorded caregiving observation | “Submitting a check-in noting reduced capacity this sprint.” |
| **Stability** | Conditions remain within declared bounds | “The system remains stable relative to stated reliability intent.” |
| **Drift** | Gradual divergence from declared assumptions | “Check-in notes gradual drift from the original rollout assumptions.” |
| **Divergence** | Observable difference from declared bounds | “Observed divergence from the agreed business rule.” |
| **Capacity Change** | Ability to follow through has shifted | “Capacity reduced due to overlapping absences.” |
| **Stress Response** | Adaptive behavior under pressure | “This appears to be a stress response, not a defect.” |
| **Decompensation** | System can no longer maintain stability | “The service decompensated under sustained load.” |
| **Paused Intentionally** | Execution is deliberately suspended | “Work is paused intentionally pending reassessment.” |
| **Observations Inconclusive** | Insufficient evidence to assess | “Current signals are inconclusive.” |
| **Care Recommendation** | Optional supportive suggestion | “Additional monitoring may be beneficial.” |
| **Impact on Decision** | How conditions affect decision viability | “This drift may affect the decision’s defensibility.” |

**Rule:**  
Caregiving language describes **impact on declared decisions**, never intent or motivation.

### B. Alignment / Deliberation Vocabulary  
*(Used when revisiting or revising intent)*

| Term | Meaning / Usage | Example |
|-----|------------------|---------|
| **Alignment** | Intent and behavior support each other | “The team remains aligned with the stated mission.” |
| **Misalignment** | Intent and behavior no longer cohere | “There is misalignment between current behavior and intent.” |
| **Purpose Drift** | Intent erodes gradually over time | “We may be experiencing purpose drift.” |
| **Unmet Assumption** | A relied-upon condition no longer holds | “The assumption about demand no longer holds.” |
| **Reassessment Requested** | Intent or decision requires review | “A reassessment is requested for this decision.” |
| **Renegotiation** | Explicit revision of scope or commitment | “We propose renegotiating scope.” |
| **Experiment** | Time-bound learning without commitment | “We propose an experiment before committing.” |
| **Commitment** | Durable update to declared intent | “This represents a new commitment.” |
| **Coordination** | Multiple identities must align | “This requires coordination across teams.” |
| **Alignment Signal** | Intent-level signal shared externally | “Reliability is prioritized over throughput.” |

**Note:**  
Alignment signals never include clinical detail, metrics, or enforcement logic.

## 4. Language Boundary Rule

**Caregiving language:**
- reports
- observes
- preserves dignity
- protects silence

**Alignment language:**
- deliberates
- revises
- coordinates
- recommits

If language feels:
- coercive
- judgmental
- performance-oriented
- optimization-driven

…then the boundary has been violated.

---

## 5. Closing Perspective

Vocabulary is not cosmetic.

It is a **structural safeguard** that:
- prevents silent authority
- keeps observation separate from control
- enables honesty without punishment
- allows care to scale without fear

Check-ins are acts of care.  
Alignment is an act of choice.

Keeping these distinct is what allows VDS and VLS — and Charter —  
to remain legitimate, humane, and trustworthy over time.
