# VDS Federation — Care, Autonomy, and Boundary Integrity

> **A structure for sharing alignment signals across autonomous systems  
without authority transfer, identity mutation, or coercion.**

This document defines federation **at the Value-Directed System (VDS) layer only**.

It formalizes what VDS federation is, what it is not, and how caregiving signals
propagate across independent identities while preserving autonomy.

VLS (Value Lineage System) governs identity, version, and structural evolution.
VDS federation never mutates identity or version.

Federation is not an implementation detail.
It is a structural commitment to care without control.

---

## 1. Purpose of VDS Federation

VDS federation exists to enable:

- Shared visibility of alignment signals
- Cross-boundary understanding of drift
- Coordinated awareness without coordinated enforcement
- Care at scale without structural collapse

It does not exist to:

- Enforce behavior
- Synchronize operational state
- Coordinate deployments
- Mutate identity or scope
- Create authority hierarchies

A federated VDS does not ask:

> “What should they do?”

It asks:

> “What are they observing relative to their declared decisions,  
> and how does that relate to our declared decisions?”

---

## 2. Federation Propagates Signals, Not State

VDS federation shares:

- Check-ins
- Supportability degradation signals
- Declared experiment context (metadata only)
- Escalation summaries
- Silence (explicitly recorded stability)

It does not share:

- Raw telemetry
- Execution instructions
- Deployment commands
- Structural mutations
- Identity version changes

Federation synchronizes **interpretation artifacts**, not runtime behavior.

---

## 3. Autonomy Is Preserved at Every Boundary

Every federated VDS:

- Owns its observation scope
- Interprets relative to its own declared decisions
- Maintains local authority over escalation thresholds
- Preserves local cadence and posture

Federation must never:

- Override local decisions
- Imply obligation
- Collapse distinct identities
- Treat visibility as consent

**Invariant**

> Visibility does not imply obligation.  
> Awareness does not imply authority.

---

## 4. Federation Is Graph-Based, Not Hierarchical

VDS federation forms a graph of caregiving systems.

- There is no inherent root.
- There is no automatic upstream authority.
- Centrality exists only by explicit human declaration.

Each node:

- Maintains its own caregiving posture
- Aggregates external signals voluntarily
- Decides independently how to interpret shared check-ins

Federation distributes awareness, not power.

---

## 5. Escalation Across Federation

Escalation in federation increases visibility — never pressure.

Examples of federated signals:

- Persistent misalignment relative to declared value
- Supportability degradation across multiple areas
- Prolonged instability beyond declared deployment window
- Repeated requests for clarification

Escalation does not:

- Mandate intervention
- Transfer decision rights
- Trigger automated coordination
- Modify identity or version

Escalation prevents silent drift.
It does not force convergence.

---

## 6. Supportability Degradation in Federation

Supportability degradation may propagate across federation.

Example:

> “Identity A reports sustained inability to demonstrate cost predictability.”

Other identities may:

- Reflect on dependency relationships
- Assess their own declared commitments
- Issue local requests for clarification

They may not:

- Diagnose the remote system
- Enforce corrective measures
- Assume structural failure

Supportability degradation is informational, not accusatory.

---

## 7. Deployment Windows and Instability Context

When a federated participant declares a deployment window:

- That context may propagate as metadata.
- Escalation cadence may adjust locally.
- Aggregation may replace repetitive signaling.

Deployment context does not:

- Suspend observation
- Suppress misalignment
- Alter identity or scope
- Change version numbers

Instability in one node does not structurally cascade across federation.

Each identity interprets instability relative to its own declared intent.

---

## 8. Silence as a Federated Signal

Silence propagates as stability.

A federated VDS may explicitly share:

> “No material change relative to declared decisions.”

Silence is:

- Legitimate
- Informational
- Non-suspicious by default

Federation must not manufacture urgency due to inactivity.

---

## 9. Identity and Version Integrity

VDS federation does not mutate structural definitions.

Specifically, federation must not:

- Change identity
- Modify scope
- Increment version numbers
- Trigger sunset
- Create structural deprecation

Identity evolution is governed outside the VDS layer (see VLS documentation).

VDS federation propagates care signals only.

Structural evolution requires explicit declaration.

---

## 10. Conflict Visibility Without Arbitration

Federated systems may expose conflicting signals.

Example:

- Identity A reports stability.
- Identity B reports dependency risk from A.

Federation:

- Makes divergence visible.
- Preserves authorship.
- Does not arbitrate truth.

Conflict remains a valid system state.

Resolution requires explicit human decision.

---

## 11. Aggregation Without Authority Emergence

Large federations may aggregate signals.

Aggregation may:

- Summarize repeated misalignment
- Consolidate instability windows
- Represent cross-identity degradation patterns

Aggregation must not:

- Create implied command structures
- Establish implicit hierarchy
- Convert frequency into authority

Frequency increases visibility — not legitimacy.

---

## 12. What VDS Federation Never Does

VDS federation never:

- Pushes changes
- Applies decisions
- Coordinates deployments
- Executes remediation
- Mutates identity or version
- Enforces alignment
- Suppresses disagreement

It preserves autonomy while amplifying clarity.

---

## Closing Perspective

VDS federation is **care distributed across boundaries**.

It allows systems to:

- Share alignment signals
- Surface cross-identity impact
- Reflect on interdependence
- Maintain dignity and ownership

It does not make systems behave the same.

It makes differences visible without turning them into violations.

Federation does not create control.  
It creates shared awareness under structural restraint.
