# What Is a Value Lineage System (VLS)

A **Value Lineage System (VLS)** is a passive, identity-level system that preserves
**intent, legitimacy, and continuity over time**.

Where many systems ask *“Are we working?”*  
VLS asks a different question:

> **“Who are we now — and how did we get here?”**

A VLS does not observe behavior.
It does not evaluate health.
It does not guide action.

It exists to **remember identity, purpose, and conscious change** —
especially across time, scale, and organizational transformation.

---

## Core Purpose

A Value Lineage System exists to:

- Preserve **identity** across change
- Represent **intent explicitly and durably**
- Track **evolution, deprecation, and abandonment** without erasure
- Maintain **legitimacy** by making change narratable
- Enable coherence without forcing consistency

VLS is concerned with **meaning**, not outcomes.

---

## What VLS Observes

A VLS observes **decisions about identity and intent**, not system behavior.

Specifically, it tracks:

- Declared mission or purpose
- Scope of responsibility (what this identity owns)
- Changes to that scope over time
- Explicit additions, removals, or redefinitions of intent
- Deprecated or abandoned intent that remains historically relevant
- Conflicts or overlaps between identities

It preserves **lineage**, not performance.

---

## Identity as the Central Concept

In VLS, an **identity** is:

- Singular within its declared domain
- Defined by **scope and intent**
- Durable across time
- Capable of change without being replaced

A helpful mental model is a **department**:

- A department may gain or lose scope
- Its mission may evolve
- Some work may become deprecated
- Yet the department remains *itself* unless its scope fundamentally changes

A change of **scope** may result in:
- A purpose change (same identity)
- Or an identity change (new identity, new lineage)

VLS makes this distinction explicit.

---

## Deprecation Is Not Failure

VLS uses **descriptive states**, not judgments.

- **Active** — aligned with current intent
- **Deprecated** — still active, but no longer aligned
- **Abandoned** — no longer active, preserved for history

These states apply to **work, goals, or intents** — never to people.

This allows systems and organizations to:
- Change without shame
- Let go without erasure
- Learn without rewriting history

---

## What VLS Does *Not* Do

A Value Lineage System does **not**:

- Monitor system health
- Track metrics or telemetry
- Recommend actions
- Enforce decisions
- Optimize behavior
- Escalate urgency on its own

Silence is meaningful.
Stability is not suspicious.
Inactivity does not imply failure.

## Relationship Between VLS and VDS

VLS and VDS are complementary but operate at **different layers**.

### Value-Directed System (VDS)
- Observes **behavior**
- Evaluates **alignment with declared decisions**
- Reports **health, drift, and care signals**
- Operates within a defined scope
- Can forget detailed telemetry over time
- Exists to support **care and alignment**

### Value Lineage System (VLS)
- Observes **identity and intent**
- Preserves **mission-level continuity**
- Tracks **evolution across time**
- Never forgets intent history
- Exists to preserve **legitimacy and coherence**

**In short:**

- VDS asks: *“Is this system meeting its goals?”*
- VLS asks: *“Are these still our goals — and when did that change?”*

---

## Authority and Escalation

VLS holds **no authority**.

However, it provides a legitimate surface for escalation:

- VDS may escalate **persistent misalignment** to VLS
- VLS may surface **identity-level incoherence**
- Humans decide whether identity, scope, or mission should change

VLS never concludes *what should be done*.
It ensures that **whatever is done is explainable**.

---

## Federation in VLS

VLS federation is:

- **Graph-based**, not hierarchical
- Based on **baseline review**, not trust
- Concerned with **shared mission**, not shared methods
- Designed for **parallel realities**, not convergence

Each VLS represents its own reality.
Federation allows those realities to **compare intent**, not merge authority.

---

## Why VLS Is Necessary

Without a Value Lineage System:

- Identity changes silently
- Purpose drifts without acknowledgment
- Deprecated work lingers without language
- Conflicts become political instead of structural
- Organizations lose the ability to explain themselves

VLS restores the ability to say:

> “This is who we are.
> This is who we were.
> This is what we consciously let go.
> And this is what still binds us.”

---

## In One Sentence

A Value Lineage System preserves **who a system is**
so that Value-Directed Systems can responsibly care for **what it does**.

It does not guide change.
It makes change legitimate.
