# What Is a Value Lineage System (VLS)

A **Value Lineage System (VLS)** is a passive, identity-level system that preserves
**intent, legitimacy, and continuity over time**.

Where many systems ask *“Are we working?”*  
VLS asks a different question:

> **“Who are we now — and how did we get here?”**

A VLS does not observe behavior.  
It does not evaluate health.  
It does not guide action.

It exists to **remember identity, purpose, and conscious change** —  
especially across time, scale, and organizational transformation.

---

## Core Purpose

A Value Lineage System exists to:

- Preserve **identity** across change  
- Represent **intent explicitly and durably**  
- Track **evolution, deprecation, and abandonment** without erasure  
- Maintain **legitimacy** by making change narratable  
- Enable coherence without forcing consistency  
- Document **planned transitions**, including deployment windows, for visibility across teams  

VLS is concerned with **meaning**, not outcomes.

---

## What VLS Observes

A VLS observes **decisions about identity and intent**, not system behavior.

Specifically, it tracks:

- Declared mission or purpose  
- Scope of responsibility (what this identity owns)  
- Changes to that scope over time  
- Explicit additions, removals, or redefinitions of intent  
- Deprecated or abandoned intent that remains historically relevant  
- Conflicts or overlaps between identities  

It preserves **lineage**, not performance.

---

## Identity as the Central Concept

In VLS, an **identity** is:

- Singular within its declared domain  
- Defined by **scope and intent**  
- Durable across time  
- Capable of change without being replaced  

A helpful mental model is a **department**:

- A department may gain or lose scope  
- Its mission may evolve  
- Some work may become deprecated  
- Yet the department remains *itself* unless its scope fundamentally changes  

**Scope changes** have consequences:

- Minor scope adjustments may update purpose without creating a new identity  
- Irreversible or large scope changes constitute **identity evolution** and trigger a new lineage  
- In versioned systems, major scope changes correspond to **major version increments**  

**Example:**  
A Platform Engineering team takes on a new security service previously handled elsewhere.  
- VLS records the expanded scope and any newly declared intent.  
- Existing intent remains visible and auditable.  
- The identity is the same, but its lineage now reflects the deliberate evolution.

---

## Deprecation Is Not Failure

VLS uses **descriptive states**, not judgments:

- **Active** — aligned with current intent  
- **Deprecated** — still active, but no longer aligned  
- **Abandoned** — no longer active, preserved for history  

These states apply to **work, goals, or intents** — never to people.

This allows systems and organizations to:

- Change without shame  
- Let go without erasure  
- Learn without rewriting history

---

## What VLS Does *Not* Do

A Value Lineage System does **not**:

- Monitor system health  
- Track metrics or telemetry  
- Recommend actions  
- Enforce decisions  
- Optimize behavior  
- Escalate urgency on its own  

Silence is meaningful.  
Stability is not suspicious.  
Inactivity does not imply failure.

## Relationship Between VLS and VDS

VLS and VDS are complementary but operate at **different layers**.

| Layer | Observes | Purpose | Retention | Role |
|-------|----------|--------|-----------|------|
| **VDS** | Behavior | Care, alignment, drift | Telemetry may age out | Supports deliberate action and caregiving |
| **VLS** | Identity & intent | Lineage, legitimacy | Never forgets | Preserves truth across time and evolution |

**In short:**

- VDS asks: *“Is this system meeting its goals?”*  
- VLS asks: *“Are these still our goals — and when did that change?”*

---

## Authority and Escalation

VLS holds **no authority**.

However, it provides a legitimate surface for escalation:

- VDS may escalate **persistent misalignment** to VLS  
- VLS may surface **identity-level incoherence**  
- Humans decide whether identity, scope, or mission should change  

VLS never concludes *what should be done*.  
It ensures that **whatever is done is explainable**.

---

## Federation in VLS

VLS federation is:

- **Graph-based**, not hierarchical  
- Based on **baseline review**, not trust  
- Concerned with **shared mission**, not shared methods  
- Designed for **parallel realities**, not convergence  

Each VLS represents its own reality.  
Federation allows those realities to **compare intent**, not merge authority.

VDS and VLS federations are separate; VLS does not interfere with caregiving.

---

## Why VLS Is Necessary

Without a Value Lineage System:

- Identity changes silently  
- Purpose drifts without acknowledgment  
- Deprecated work lingers without language  
- Conflicts become political instead of structural  
- Organizations lose the ability to explain themselves  

VLS restores the ability to say:

> “This is who we are.  
> This is who we were.  
> This is what we consciously let go.  
> And this is what still binds us.”

## In One Sentence

A Value Lineage System preserves **who a system is**  
so that Value-Directed Systems can responsibly care for **what it does**.

It does not guide change.  
It makes change legitimate.
