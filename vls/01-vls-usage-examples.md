# Value Lineage System (VLS) — Usage Examples

Status: OPTIONAL (Strongly Recommended)  
Purpose: Make VLS legible through lived scenarios  
Audience: Humans evaluating whether this archetype applies to their reality  

This document illustrates how a Value Lineage System (VLS) is used in practice.
These examples are **descriptive, not prescriptive**.
They are meant to help readers *recognize their own situations*,
not to define workflows or implementations.

---

## Example 1: A Department Gains Scope

**Scenario**  
An Infrastructure department is asked to take ownership of security tooling
that was previously handled elsewhere.

**What Typically Happens (Without VLS)**  
- The department’s mission statement is quietly updated.
- Old priorities fade without acknowledgment.
- Conflicts emerge months later when trade-offs appear.
- No one can explain when or why the shift happened.

**What Happens With VLS**  
- The department’s **identity remains the same**.
- A **scope expansion** is explicitly recorded.
- New intent is added alongside existing intent.
- Older goals remain visible, even if deprioritized.

**Result**  
- The department can explain *who it is now* and *how it got here*.
- Future misalignment is diagnosable, not political.
- No history is erased to make the present feel cleaner.

## Example 2: A Department Loses Scope

**Scenario**  
A Product Operations group hands off deployment responsibility
to a centralized platform team.

**Key VLS Insight**  
This is an **identity change**, not a performance failure.

**With VLS**  
- The loss of scope is explicitly recorded.
- The department’s purpose narrows, but identity persists.
- Work tied to the old scope becomes **deprecated**, not invalid.

**Important Detail**  
Deprecated work may continue temporarily
due to contracts, staffing, or transition constraints.
This is visible and legitimate.

**Result**  
- No one is blamed for “not doing their job anymore.”
- The system preserves dignity during organizational change.
- Alignment conversations are grounded in recorded truth.

## Example 3: Department Split Into Two Identities

**Scenario**  
A single department is split into:
- Platform Engineering
- Developer Experience

**With VLS**  
- Two new identities are created.
- Each inherits relevant parts of the prior lineage.
- Shared history is preserved, not duplicated or erased.
- Divergence is expected and explicit.

**What This Prevents**  
- Endless debates about “what we used to mean.”
- Rewriting history to justify present structure.
- Artificial coherence forced for convenience.

**Result**  
Two legitimate identities, both traceable,
neither required to pretend continuity they no longer have.

## Example 4: Long-Running Deprecated Work

**Scenario**  
A reporting pipeline still runs,
but no longer supports current mission goals.

**Without VLS**  
- The work is labeled “legacy.”
- Engineers feel pressure to defend or delete it.
- Knowledge erodes quietly.

**With VLS**  
- The work is marked **deprecated**.
- Its original value remains documented.
- Its current misalignment is visible but non-urgent.

**Key Insight**  
Deprecated does not mean:
- useless
- wrong
- embarrassing

It means:
> “This no longer serves what we currently intend.”

**Result**  
The organization can decide *when* and *how* to let go,
without pretending the work never mattered.

---

## Example 5: Mission Redefinition Without Identity Change

**Scenario**  
A department shifts from “cost optimization”
to “resilience and reliability.”

**With VLS**  
- Identity remains unchanged.
- Old mission intent is preserved.
- New mission intent is explicitly declared.
- Conflicts between old and new goals become visible.

**Why This Matters**  
The system can now answer:
- Which work supports which era of intent?
- Where is drift occurring?
- What trade-offs are intentional?

**Result**  
Change is narratable.
No one needs to pretend the past was a mistake.

---

## Example 6: Parallel Identities With Partial Overlap

**Scenario**  
Security and Compliance teams both care about auditability,
but for different reasons.

**With VLS**  
- Each team retains its own identity.
- Overlapping intent is visible, not merged.
- Conflicts are framed as *intent differences*, not turf wars.

**Federation Note**  
These identities may federate later,
but federation does not erase difference.

**Result**  
Coordination without forced consensus.

---

## Closing Reflection

VLS is most valuable where change is:
- slow
- human
- political
- emotionally loaded

It does not resolve these tensions.
It makes them **visible, durable, and discussable**.

If these examples feel familiar,
you are already living in a world that needs value lineage —
whether you call it that or not.
