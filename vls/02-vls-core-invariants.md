# Value Lineage System (VLS) — Core Invariants

Status: FOUNDATIONAL  
Intent: Legitimacy Lock-In  
Scope: Any system claiming to preserve value, identity, or mission lineage over time  

This document defines the **non-negotiable invariants** of a Value Lineage System (VLS).

These invariants exist to preserve:

- Legitimacy across change  
- Continuity of identity  
- Mechanical integrity of evolution  
- Compassion in deprecation and abandonment  
- Auditability without blame or coercion  

A system that violates these invariants is not a VLS,  
regardless of implementation, scale, or stated intent.

---

## I. Identity Is Scoped, Singular, and Non-Derived

A VLS tracks **identity**, not behavior, performance, compliance, health, or outcomes.

- An identity represents a bounded domain of responsibility or influence  
  (e.g., department, product, system, organization).
- An identity has **one declared scope at a time**.
- Identity is not inferred from activity, metrics, structure, or success.
- An identity may collaborate with others, but is never merged implicitly.

Fail if:

- An identity’s scope is implicit, shifting, or reconstructed after the fact.
- Multiple unrelated scopes are collapsed into a single identity for convenience.
- Identity is derived from metrics, performance, authority, or operational state.

---

## II. Identity Evolution Is Explicit and Versioned

Identity persists across versions.  
Structural evolution is tracked mechanically.

- Every identity has a version.
- Version increments are deterministically derived from structural change.
- Major version increments occur when purpose changes within the same scope or when scope boundaries shift.
- Minor version increments occur when scope expands within the same bounded domain.
- Patch increments occur for clarifications or corrective lineage records.
- Version numbers may not be manually mutated after initialization.
- Retroactive corrections create new records; they do not rewrite prior versions.

Version reflects structural evolution — not urgency, performance, or preference.

Fail if:

- Version numbers are arbitrarily edited.
- Structural change occurs without version increment.
- Version increments are tied to operational events.
- History is rewritten instead of appended.

---

## III. Identity Is Not Replaced by Purpose

Purpose exists *within* an identity’s scope.

- Purpose may evolve.
- Purpose change constitutes a major version increment.
- Identity continuity persists unless scope boundaries change.

Identity changes only when its bounded domain of responsibility is redefined.

Fail if:

- A purpose change overwrites or collapses identity history.
- Scope mutation is treated as a routine update.
- Continuity is asserted where responsibility boundaries have shifted.

---

## IV. Intent Is Explicit, Declared, and Durable

All intent preserved by a VLS must be explicit.

- Missions, goals, and priorities are declared — never inferred.
- Intent remains valid until consciously changed or deprecated.
- Inactivity does not imply abandonment, error, or irrelevance.

Fail if:

- Intent is inferred from activity, outcomes, or success.
- Intent disappears due to lack of updates.
- Silence is interpreted as disengagement.

---

## V. History Is Additive and Never Rewritten

A VLS never rewrites the past.

- Identities, versions, intents, transitions, deprecations, and sunsets are append-only.
- Corrections create new records.
- Earlier meaning remains intact even when superseded.

Understanding improves by accumulation — not revision.

Fail if:

- Prior intent is reinterpreted retroactively.
- Lineage is compressed in a way that erases context.
- History is edited to appear coherent after the fact.

---

## VI. Deprecation Is Descriptive, Not Evaluative

Deprecation describes **relationship to current declared intent**, not worth, quality, or competence.

- Deprecated work may remain active.
- Deprecated scope is not failure.
- Deprecation indicates structural misalignment, not error.

Fail if:

- Deprecation is framed as waste or incompetence.
- Deprecation triggers urgency or enforcement.
- Deprecated states are treated as liabilities by default.

---

## VII. Identity Retirement Requires Explicit Sunset

Identity versions do not disappear implicitly.

- Retirement requires an explicit sunset declaration.
- Sunset defines a lifecycle transition, not deletion.
- Prior versions may coexist with newer versions until sunset.
- Sunset does not rewrite or compress lineage.

Parallel versions during transition are legitimate.

Fail if:

- Identity versions disappear without declaration.
- Sunset deletes or erases history.
- Operational instability triggers identity retirement automatically.

---

## VIII. Operational State Does Not Mutate Identity

Operational conditions do not alter lineage.

- Deployment windows do not change identity.
- System failure does not change identity.
- Health state does not trigger version increments.
- Instability does not mutate scope.
- Panic does not create structural evolution.

Only explicit structural declarations mutate identity.

Fail if:

- Identity changes in response to runtime conditions.
- Version increments are tied to deployment events.
- Health metrics influence lineage state.

---

## IX. Federation Is Graph-Based and Non-Hierarchical

VLS federation forms a **graph of timelines**, not a chain of authority.

- Each VLS represents its own valid lineage.
- No VLS is inherently authoritative over another.
- Centrality exists only by explicit declaration.

Fail if:

- Federation assumes a default source of truth.
- Synchronization implies obedience or superiority.
- Authority emerges accidentally through aggregation.

---

## X. Federation Requires Explicit Baseline Review

No VLS trusts another by default.

- Synchronization requires explicit baseline review.
- Differences in scope, intent, or history are expected.
- Alignment is negotiated, never assumed.

Fail if:

- Lineage is merged automatically.
- Differences are treated as errors.
- Synchronization erases local meaning.

---

## XI. Silence Is a First-Class and Legitimate State

Lack of change is not failure.

- Stability may indicate coherence.
- Deprecated or sunset states may persist intentionally.
- Absence of updates does not imply neglect.

Fail if:

- The system pressures change due to inactivity.
- Silence is interpreted as decay by default.
- Movement is required to justify legitimacy.

---

## XII. Observation Does Not Create Authority

A VLS never directs action.

- It does not recommend fixes.
- It does not escalate urgency.
- It does not enforce alignment.
- It does not compel convergence.

A VLS surfaces structural truth.  
Humans decide what to do with it.

Fail if:

- Observation implies obligation.
- Lineage is treated as instruction.
- History is used to compel behavior.

---

## XIII. Legitimacy Emerges From Clarity, Not Agreement

Alignment is not required for legitimacy.

- Conflicting intents may coexist.
- Divergence is acceptable and visible.
- Legitimacy comes from explicitness and preservation — not consensus.

Fail if:

- Conflict is suppressed to force coherence.
- Legitimacy is tied to conformity or success.
- Dissent is treated as defect.

---

## Closing Statement

A Value Lineage System exists to remember faithfully.

It preserves:

- Who an identity has been  
- What it has declared  
- How it has evolved  
- What it has consciously released  

It does not optimize.  
It does not govern.  
It does not judge.

Its role is structural and disciplined:

**To make identity evolution durable without making anyone a villain.**
