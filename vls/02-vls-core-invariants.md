# Value Lineage System (VLS) — Core Invariants

Status: FOUNDATIONAL  
Intent: Legitimacy Lock-In  
Scope: Any system claiming to preserve value, identity, or mission lineage over time  

This document defines the **non-negotiable invariants** of a Value Lineage System (VLS).

These invariants exist to preserve:

- legitimacy across change  
- continuity of identity  
- compassion in deprecation and abandonment  
- auditability without blame or coercion  

A system that violates these invariants is not a VLS,  
regardless of implementation, scale, or stated intent.

---

## I. Identity Is Scoped, Singular, and Non-Derived

A VLS tracks **identity**, not behavior, performance, compliance, or outcomes.

- An identity represents a bounded domain of responsibility or influence
  (e.g. department, product, system, organization).
- An identity has **one scope at a time**.
- Identity is not inferred from activity, structure, or success.
- An identity may collaborate with others, but is never merged implicitly.

Fail if:
- An identity’s scope is implicit, shifting, or reconstructed after the fact.
- Multiple unrelated scopes are collapsed into a single identity for convenience.
- Identity is derived from metrics, performance, or authority.

---

## II. Identity Is Not Replaced by Purpose

Purpose may change.  
Identity does not.

- Purpose exists *within* an identity’s scope.
- Purpose changes are legitimate evolutions, not replacements.
- Identity changes only when scope is explicitly added or removed.

Fail if:
- A purpose change overwrites or collapses identity history.
- Scope change is treated as a routine update or optimization.
- Continuity is asserted where it no longer exists.

---

## III. Intent Is Explicit, Declared, and Durable

All intent preserved by a VLS must be explicit.

- Missions, goals, and priorities are declared, not inferred.
- Intent remains valid until consciously changed or deprecated.
- Inactivity does not imply abandonment, error, or irrelevance.

Fail if:
- Intent is inferred from activity, outcomes, or success.
- Intent disappears due to lack of recent updates.
- Silence is interpreted as disengagement.

---

## IV. History Is Additive and Never Rewritten

A VLS never rewrites the past.

- Identities, intents, decisions, transitions, and deprecations are append-only.
- Corrections create new records; they do not alter prior meaning.
- Understanding improves by accumulation, not revision.

Fail if:
- Prior intent is reinterpreted retroactively.
- Lineage is compressed in a way that loses original context.
- History is edited to appear coherent after the fact.

---

## V. Deprecation Is Descriptive, Not Evaluative

Deprecation describes **relationship to current intent**, not worth, quality, or competence.

- Deprecated work may remain active.
- Deprecated work is not failure.
- Deprecation indicates misalignment, not error.

Fail if:
- Deprecation is framed as waste, mistake, or incompetence.
- Deprecation triggers urgency, enforcement, or corrective pressure.
- Deprecated states are treated as liabilities by default.

---

## VI. Abandonment Is Preserved Without Shame

Abandonment is a state, not a verdict.

- Abandoned work remains part of lineage.
- Abandonment may result from context change, constraint change, or decision change.
- No moral or performance meaning is attached.

Fail if:
- Abandoned work is hidden, deleted, or erased.
- Abandonment is framed as negligence, failure, or embarrassment.
- History is cleaned to avoid discomfort.

---

## VII. Federation Is Graph-Based and Non-Hierarchical

VLS federation forms a **graph of timelines**, not a chain of authority.

- Each VLS represents its own valid history and reality.
- No VLS is inherently authoritative over another.
- Centrality, primacy, or anchoring exists only by explicit human declaration.

Fail if:
- Federation assumes a default source of truth.
- Synchronization implies obedience, correctness, or superiority.
- Authority emerges accidentally through aggregation.

---

## VIII. Federation Requires Explicit Baseline Review

No VLS trusts another by default.

- Synchronization requires explicit baseline review.
- Differences in intent, scope, or history are expected.
- Alignment is negotiated, not assumed.

Fail if:
- Lineage is merged automatically.
- Differences are treated as errors to be corrected.
- Synchronization erases local meaning.

---

## IX. Silence Is a First-Class and Legitimate State

Lack of change is not failure.

- Stability may indicate coherence.
- Deprecated or abandoned states may persist intentionally.
- Absence of updates does not imply neglect or misalignment.

Fail if:
- The system pressures change due to inactivity.
- Silence is interpreted as decay or failure by default.
- Movement is required to justify legitimacy.

---

## X. Observation Does Not Create Authority

A VLS never directs action.

- It does not recommend fixes.
- It does not escalate urgency.
- It does not enforce alignment or behavior.

A VLS surfaces truth.  
Humans decide what to do with it.

Fail if:
- Observation implies obligation.
- Lineage is treated as instruction.
- History is used to compel action.

---

## XI. Legitimacy Emerges From Clarity, Not Agreement

Alignment is not required for legitimacy.

- Conflicting intents may coexist.
- Divergence is acceptable and visible.
- Legitimacy comes from explicitness and preservation, not consensus.

Fail if:
- Conflict is suppressed to force coherence.
- Legitimacy is tied to conformity, success, or outcomes.
- Dissent is treated as defect.

---

## Closing Statement

A Value Lineage System exists to remember faithfully.

It preserves:
- who an identity has been
- what it has cared about
- what it has consciously released

It does not optimize.  
It does not govern.  
It does not judge.

Its role is simple and difficult:

**to make truth durable without making anyone a villain.**
