# Value Lineage System (VLS) — Deprecation, Identity, and Alignment

> *A truth-surfacing system that doesn’t require villains.*

This document explains **why the Value Lineage System (VLS) deprecation model works**, how it preserves legitimacy and compassion, and why it scales without becoming political, punitive, or coercive.

VLS exists to preserve **identity, intent, and continuity over time** —  
not to manage behavior, performance, or health.

---

## 1. What VLS Observes

VLS observes **work in relation to declared intent**.

It does not observe:
- system health
- operational metrics
- performance trends
- behavioral compliance

Those belong to Value-Directed Systems (VDS).

VLS observes:
- what identities claim to exist
- what scope they declare
- what intent they commit to
- how that intent evolves, narrows, expands, or is released

VLS is concerned with **who the system is becoming**, not how well it is performing.

---

## 2. Deprecation Statuses (Descriptive, Not Judgmental)

VLS uses **states of work relative to intent**, not states of people or competence.

### Active
- Work is ongoing
- Work contributes to currently declared intent
- Identity, scope, and purpose remain coherent

### Deprecated
- Work is ongoing
- Work no longer contributes to current declared intent
- Indicates *misalignment*, not failure

### Abandoned
- Work has stopped or cannot continue
- Caused by decision change, scope loss, or context shift
- Preserved for lineage, memory, and learning

**Why this works**
- Status describes *relationship to intent*, not merit
- No moral weight is assigned
- History remains intact
- Change becomes narratable rather than abrupt or erased

Deprecation is not accusation.
It is **signal**.

## 3. Deprecated Does Not Mean Wrong

When work becomes deprecated, VLS treats this as a **diagnostic condition**, not a verdict.

Possible interpretations include:
- **Missing decision**  
  The work was never explicitly tied to current intent
- **Value drift**  
  The identity is faithfully serving an older or superseded mission
- **Scope mismatch**  
  The work may still be valuable, but not within this identity
- **Context change**  
  External conditions shifted without fault

**Invariant**
> VLS never concludes *why* something is misaligned.  
> It only makes the mismatch visible.

Agency remains human.

## 4. Movement Is Guided by Questions, Not Commands

VLS never triggers action.
It never escalates urgency.
It never prescribes outcomes.

Instead, it invites reflection:

- Does this identity need a new or clarified intent?
- Has scope changed without being acknowledged?
- Should this work move to a different identity?
- Should this identity consciously release part of itself?

**Why this matters**
- Prevents coercive realignment
- Preserves dignity and ownership
- Encourages explicit commitment instead of reactive change

VLS creates space for choice.
It does not collapse it.

## 5. Conflict Without Moralization

When intents conflict:
- The conflict is explicit
- No party is framed as disobedient
- No authority is forced to intervene

VLS reframes conflict as:
> A property of declared intent, not a flaw in people or teams.

This allows questions such as:
- Which intent has priority?
- Are these intents meant to coexist?
- Is the mission underspecified or outdated?

Conflict becomes **legible**, not political.

---

## 6. Why This Scales

Most large systems fail not because of disagreement, but because:

- Intent is implicit
- Change is silent
- Deprecation is hidden
- Accountability becomes moralized

VLS avoids this by enforcing:
- Explicit identity and intent
- Descriptive, neutral language
- Preserved lineage across change
- Separation between observation and action

**Result**
- Less blame
- Fewer power struggles
- Higher trust in what the system reveals

---

## 7. The Deeper Pattern

At every level, VLS helps humans distinguish three fundamentally different situations:

1. Is something causing harm?  
   → Intervene directly (outside VLS).

2. Is something no longer aligned with intent?  
   → Reflect, decide, and commit consciously.

3. Is the system unclear about who it is or what it wants?  
   → Make identity and intent explicit.

Most organizational suffering comes from confusing these categories.

---

## Closing Perspective

VLS is not a management framework.
It is not an optimization engine.
It is not an authority structure.

It is a **lineage system** —  
a careful mirror that preserves identity, intent, and continuity over time  
so humans can decide, together, what still belongs — and what can be released.

Without VLS, federation becomes control.
With it, federation becomes understanding.
