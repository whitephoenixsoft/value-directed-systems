# Value Lineage System (VLS) — Deprecation, Identity, and Alignment

> *A truth-surfacing system that doesn’t require villains.*

This document explains **why the Value Lineage System (VLS) deprecation model works**, how it preserves legitimacy and compassion, and why it scales without becoming political, punitive, or coercive.

VLS exists to preserve **identity, intent, and continuity over time** —  
not to manage behavior, performance, health, deployment, or operational control.

It is a lineage system, not a monitoring system.

---

## 1. What VLS Observes

VLS observes **declared identity and declared intent over time**.

It does not observe:
- System health  
- Operational metrics  
- Performance trends  
- Behavioral compliance  
- Runtime activity  

Those belong to Value-Directed Systems (VDS).

VLS observes:
- What identities claim to be  
- What scope they declare  
- What purpose they commit to  
- How that identity evolves, narrows, expands, versions, or is released  

VLS is concerned with **who the system declares itself to be becoming**,  
not how well it is performing.

---

## 2. Identity, Versioning, and Lineage Continuity

Identity evolution is explicit.

When structural changes occur:

- Version increments are mechanically derived  
- Manual version edits are not permitted  
- Lineage continuity is preserved across versions  

Version numbers reflect structural identity change — not performance, urgency, or preference.

When a new identity version is introduced:

- A prior version may remain active  
- A sunset date may be declared  
- Parallel versions may coexist temporarily  

Deletion is prohibited.  
History remains narratable.

Evolution is additive, not destructive.

---

## 3. Deprecation Statuses (Descriptive, Not Judgmental)

VLS uses **states of relationship to declared intent**, not states of people or competence.

### Active
- Identity and its declared work align with current intent  
- Scope and purpose remain coherent  

### Deprecated
- Declared scope or work no longer aligns with current declared intent  
- Indicates structural misalignment, not failure  

### Abandoned
- Identity or scope has been consciously released  
- Work has stopped or is no longer continued  
- Preserved for lineage, memory, and learning  

### Sunset (Lifecycle State)
- A specific identity version is scheduled for end-of-support  
- May remain active until the declared sunset date  
- Exists during structural transition  

**Important Distinction**

- *Deprecated* describes misalignment within an active identity.  
- *Sunset* describes lifecycle transition between identity versions.

Deprecation is not accusation.  
Sunset is not erasure.

Both are descriptive signals.

---

## 4. Deprecated Does Not Mean Wrong

When something becomes deprecated, VLS treats this as a **diagnostic visibility condition**, not a verdict.

Possible interpretations include:

- **Missing decision**  
  The identity evolved without explicit acknowledgment.

- **Value drift**  
  The identity is faithfully serving an older or superseded mission.

- **Scope mismatch**  
  The work may still be valuable, but not within this identity.

- **Context change**  
  External conditions shifted without fault.

**Invariant**
> VLS never concludes *why* misalignment exists.  
> It only makes structural mismatch visible.

Agency remains human.

## 5. Identity Evolution and Coexistence

When identity evolves:

- A new version may be declared  
- A previous version may receive a sunset date  
- Both may coexist temporarily  
- Both remain traceable within lineage  

VLS does not:

- Collapse versions automatically  
- Merge identities implicitly  
- Force deactivation  

Parallel existence is allowed.  
Ambiguity must be explicit, not accidental.

---

## 6. Movement Is Guided by Questions, Not Commands

VLS never triggers action.  
It never escalates urgency.  
It never prescribes outcomes.

Instead, it invites reflection:

- Does this identity need clarified intent?
- Has scope expanded without explicit versioning?
- Should part of this identity move elsewhere?
- Is a new identity warranted?
- Should a version enter sunset intentionally?

VLS creates space for choice.  
It does not collapse it.

---

## 7. Conflict Without Moralization

When declared intents conflict:

- The conflict is explicit  
- No party is framed as disobedient  
- No authority is automatically invoked  

Conflict becomes a property of declared identity and intent — not a flaw in people.

This enables questions such as:

- Which identity has precedence?
- Are overlapping identities intentional?
- Is versioning insufficiently explicit?
- Is purpose underspecified?

Conflict becomes legible, not political.

---

## 8. Boundaries of VLS

VLS does not:

- Observe behavior  
- Issue caregiving check-ins  
- Diagnose instability  
- Manage deployment windows  
- Control operational volatility  

Deployment timing and caregiving posture belong to other layers.

Identity lineage remains structurally independent from operational conditions.

---

## 9. Why This Scales

Large systems fail when:

- Identity is implicit  
- Versioning is arbitrary  
- Deprecation is hidden  
- Scope changes are unacknowledged  
- History is rewritten  

VLS prevents this by enforcing:

- Explicit identity declarations  
- Mechanical version derivation  
- Neutral descriptive states  
- Preserved lineage across change  
- Separation between lineage and behavior  

Result:

- Reduced blame  
- Fewer political escalations  
- Greater narrative continuity  
- Higher trust in structural truth  

---

## 10. The Deeper Pattern

VLS helps humans distinguish between three fundamentally different situations:

1. Is something causing harm?  
   → Intervene directly (outside VLS).

2. Is something no longer aligned with declared identity?  
   → Reflect, decide, and version consciously.

3. Is the system unclear about who it is or what it wants to be?  
   → Make identity and intent explicit.

Confusing these categories produces organizational instability.

VLS keeps them distinct.

## Closing Perspective

VLS is not a management framework.  
It is not an optimization engine.  
It is not an authority structure.

It is a lineage system —  
a careful structural mirror that preserves identity, intent, version, and continuity over time  
so humans can decide what still belongs — and what can be consciously released.

Without VLS, federation becomes control.  
With it, federation becomes understanding.
