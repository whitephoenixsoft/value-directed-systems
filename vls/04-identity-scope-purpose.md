# Identity, Scope, and Purpose

This document defines identity as used within Value-Directed Systems (VDS) and Value Lineage Systems (VLS).

Its purpose is to make identity explicit, bounded, and non-punitive.

## What an Identity Is

An identity is a **bounded domain of responsibility**.

It represents:
- A coherent scope of influence
- A recognizable purpose
- An accountable unit of intent

An identity is best understood as analogous to a **department**, not a person or a single system.

---

## What an Identity Is Not

An identity is not:
- A specific service or application
- A person or role
- A deployment or environment
- A temporary project

These may exist *within* an identity, but they do not define it.

---

## Scope and Domain

Every identity has:
- A defined domain of influence
- Explicit boundaries
- Local autonomy within those boundaries

If there is no domain, there is no identity.

An identity may collaborate with others, but it does not dissolve into them.

---

## Purpose and Change

An identity has **one purpose at a time**.

- Purpose may evolve
- Goals may change
- Strategies may be revised

A purpose change does **not** replace identity.

Identity only changes when:
- Scope is added or removed
- Responsibility is reassigned
- Features are added or removed irreversibly

These constitute **identity evolution**, not rollback.

---

## Deprecation and Abandonment

Work within an identity may be:
- Active
- Deprecated
- Abandoned

Deprecation means:
- Work continues
- Value alignment no longer exists

Abandonment means:
- Work has ceased
- History remains preserved

Neither implies failure or fault.

---

## Why This Matters

Clear identity:
- Prevents misplaced accountability
- Enables compassionate deprecation
- Makes federation legible
- Preserves legitimacy across change

Without identity, systems cannot know who they are —  
and without that, alignment is impossible.
