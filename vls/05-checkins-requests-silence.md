# Check-Ins, Requests, and Silence  
**(VDS / VLS Communication Model)**

This document defines how information moves through **Value-Directed Systems (VDS)** and **Value Lineage Systems (VLS)** without creating authority, urgency, or coercion.

Its purpose is to preserve:

- human agency  
- dignity of ownership  
- trust in what the system surfaces  

This model exists so that **care can scale without becoming control**.

## Check-Ins

A **check-in** is a recorded observation about the relationship between:

- declared intent  
- current conditions  
- observed behavior  

Check-ins may indicate:

- alignment  
- misalignment  
- stability  
- drift  
- deprecation  
- capacity change  

Check-ins are:

- descriptive, not prescriptive  
- contextual, not evaluative  
- voluntary, not demanded  

A check-in never implies action.  
It never assigns responsibility.  
It never asserts correctness.

A check-in simply states:

> “Here is what appears to be true relative to what was declared.”

---

## Requests

A **request** is an invitation to deliberate.

Requests may be issued by a VDS caregiving agent when check-ins reveal ambiguity, drift, or unexamined change.

A VDS may request:

- decision updates  
- clarification of intent  
- reassessment of scope  
- treatment plans or experiments  
- identity or lineage review  

Requests:

- carry no authority  
- carry no deadline  
- carry no enforcement  

They exist solely to make **gaps visible**, not to compel resolution.

A request says:

> “Something may need attention — if and when you choose.”

## Silence

Silence is a valid and meaningful state.

Silence may indicate:

- continued alignment  
- stability  
- intentional rest  
- deferred attention  
- constrained capacity  

Silence is not failure.  
Silence is not non-compliance.  
Silence is not absence of care.

Silence becomes concerning only when it conceals:

- unacknowledged drift  
- fear of reporting  
- loss of ownership  

A VDS caregiving agent may explicitly preserve silence as a reported condition:

> “No material change observed or declared.”

## Escalation Without Control

Escalation means **increased visibility**, not increased pressure.

When check-ins propagate across federation boundaries:

- context is preserved  
- authorship remains local  
- authority does not move  
- urgency is not inferred  

Federation exists to improve shared understanding —  
not to coordinate enforcement.

Visibility is informational, not hierarchical.

---

## Core Principle

No check-in is a command.  
No request is an obligation.  
No silence is an error.

This separation is what allows VDS and VLS to:

- scale across teams and individuals  
- remain psychologically safe  
- preserve legitimacy over time  
- support care without coercion  

When observation is decoupled from authority,  
truth can surface without fear —  
and alignment can be chosen, not forced.
