# Value Lineage System (VLS) — Core Invariants

Status: FOUNDATIONAL  
Intent: Legitimacy Lock-In  
Scope: Any system claiming to preserve value, identity, or mission lineage over time  

This document defines the **non-negotiable invariants** of a Value Lineage System (VLS).

These invariants exist to preserve:
- legitimacy across change
- continuity of identity
- compassion in deprecation
- auditability without blame

A system that violates these invariants is not a VLS,
regardless of implementation, scale, or stated intent.

---

## I. Identity Is Scoped and Singular

A VLS tracks **identity**, not behavior, performance, or compliance.

- An identity represents a bounded domain of responsibility or influence
  (e.g. department, product, system, organization).
- An identity has **one scope at a time**.
- An identity may collaborate with others, but is never merged implicitly.

Fail if:
- An identity’s scope is unclear, implicit, or shifting without record.
- Multiple unrelated scopes are treated as a single identity for convenience.

---

## II. Identity Is Not Replaced by Purpose

Purpose may change.  
Identity does not.

- Purpose exists *within* an identity’s scope.
- Purpose changes are legitimate evolutions, not identity replacement.
- Identity changes only when scope is explicitly added or removed.

Fail if:
- A purpose change overwrites or collapses identity history.
- Scope change is treated as a routine update.

---

## III. Intent Is Explicit and Durable

All intent tracked by a VLS must be explicit.

- Missions, goals, and priorities are declared, not inferred.
- Intent remains valid until consciously changed.
- Inactivity does not imply abandonment.

Fail if:
- Intent is inferred from activity, outcomes, or success.
- Intent disappears due to lack of recent updates.

---

## IV. History Is Preserved, Never Rewritten

A VLS never rewrites the past.

- Decisions, intents, identities, and transitions are append-only.
- Corrections create new records; they do not alter old ones.
- Understanding improves by accumulation, not revision.

Fail if:
- Prior intent is reinterpreted retroactively.
- Lineage is compressed in a way that loses original meaning.

---

## V. Deprecation Is Descriptive, Not Judgmental

Deprecation describes **relationship to current intent**, not quality or worth.

- Deprecated work may still be active.
- Deprecated work is not failure.
- Deprecation signals misalignment, not error.

Fail if:
- Deprecation is framed as waste, mistake, or incompetence.
- Deprecation triggers enforcement, urgency, or automatic action.

---

## VI. Abandonment Is Preserved Without Shame

Abandonment is a state, not a verdict.

- Abandoned work remains part of lineage.
- Abandonment may result from context change, constraint change, or decision change.
- No moral meaning is attached.

Fail if:
- Abandoned work is hidden, deleted, or erased.
- Abandonment is framed as negligence or failure.

---

## VII. Federation Is Graph-Based, Not Hierarchical

VLS federation forms a **graph of timelines**, not a chain of authority.

- Each VLS represents its own valid history and reality.
- No VLS is inherently authoritative over another.
- Centrality, roots, or anchors exist only by explicit human declaration.

Fail if:
- Federation assumes a default source of truth.
- Synchronization implies obedience or superiority.

---

## VIII. Federation Requires Baseline Review

No VLS trusts another by default.

- Synchronization requires explicit baseline review.
- Differences in intent, scope, or history are expected.
- Alignment is negotiated, not assumed.

Fail if:
- Lineage is merged automatically.
- Differences are treated as errors to be corrected.

---

## IX. Silence Is a Meaningful State

Lack of change is not failure.

- Stability may indicate coherence.
- Deprecated states may persist intentionally.
- Absence of updates does not imply neglect.

Fail if:
- The system pressures change due to inactivity.
- Silence is interpreted as misalignment by default.

---

## X. Observation Does Not Create Authority

A VLS never directs action.

- It does not recommend fixes.
- It does not escalate urgency.
- It does not enforce alignment.

It surfaces truth.
Humans decide what to do with it.

Fail if:
- Observation implies obligation.
- Lineage is used as instruction.

---

## XI. Legitimacy Emerges From Clarity, Not Agreement

Alignment is not required for legitimacy.

- Conflicting intents may coexist.
- Divergence is acceptable and visible.
- Legitimacy comes from explicitness and preservation, not consensus.

Fail if:
- Conflict is suppressed to force coherence.
- Legitimacy is tied to conformity or success.

---

## Closing Statement

A Value Lineage System exists to remember faithfully.

It preserves:
- who an identity has been
- what it has cared about
- what it has consciously released

It does not optimize.  
It does not govern.  
It does not judge.

Its role is simple and difficult:

**to make truth durable without making anyone a villain.**
