# Check-Ins, Requests, and Silence  
**(VDS / VLS Communication Model)**

This document defines how information moves through **Value-Directed Systems (VDS)** and **Value Lineage Systems (VLS)** without creating authority, urgency, coercion, or structural mutation.

Its purpose is to preserve:

- Human agency  
- Dignity of ownership  
- Trust in what the system surfaces  

This model exists so that **care can scale without becoming control**.

---

## Check-Ins

A **check-in** is a recorded observation about the relationship between:

- Declared decisions  
- Declared identity and purpose  
- Current observable conditions  

Check-ins may indicate:

- Alignment  
- Drift within bounds  
- Persistent misalignment relative to decisions  
- Capacity change  
- Stability  
- Supportability degradation (inability to demonstrate support for declared intent)  
- Observations inconclusive  

Check-ins do **not** declare structural states such as deprecation or sunset.  
Those belong to VLS.

Check-ins are:

- Descriptive, not prescriptive  
- Contextual, not evaluative  
- Append-only  
- Non-authoritative  

A check-in never implies action.  
It never assigns blame.  
It never asserts correctness.

A check-in simply states:

> “Here is what appears to be true relative to what was declared.”

---

## Supportability and Aggregation

When instability or degradation occurs:

- Check-ins may be aggregated  
- Repetitive signals may be summarized  
- Duration and scope may be consolidated  

Example:

> “Decision X lacks demonstrable support across 3 areas for 2 hours.”

Aggregation reduces noise without hiding truth.

During supportability degradation, VDS does not diagnose root cause.  
It reflects inability to demonstrate support for declared intent.

---

## Deployment Window Context

When a declared deployment window or experiment is active:

- Observation continues  
- Interpretive sensitivity may adjust  
- Drift tolerance may temporarily widen  
- Escalation cadence may change  

Deployment windows modify posture, not truth.

They do not:

- Suppress observation  
- Alter legitimacy  
- Change identity  
- Modify version numbers  

Check-ins during deployment windows remain descriptive.

---

## Requests

A **request** is an invitation to deliberate.

Requests may be issued by VDS when check-ins reveal:

- Persistent misalignment  
- Ambiguity in declared intent  
- Unexamined scope shift  
- Measurement assumptions under strain  

A VDS may request:

- Decision updates  
- Clarification of intent  
- Reassessment of scope  
- Declaration of experiment  
- Identity clarification review  

Requests:

- Carry no authority  
- Carry no deadline  
- Carry no enforcement  

A VDS may request identity clarification,  
but it cannot mutate identity, alter scope, or change version numbers.

Requests exist to surface **gaps**, not to compel resolution.

A request says:

> “Something may need attention — if and when you choose.”

---

## Silence

Silence is a valid and meaningful state.

Silence may indicate:

- Continued alignment  
- Stable supportability  
- Intentional rest  
- Declared experiment in progress  
- Active deployment window with expected volatility  
- Deferred attention  
- Constrained capacity  

Silence is not failure.  
Silence is not non-compliance.  
Silence is not absence of care.

A VDS may explicitly record silence:

> “No material change observed relative to declared decisions.”

Silence becomes concerning only when it conceals:

- Unacknowledged drift  
- Structural ambiguity  
- Loss of ownership  

Even then, concern is descriptive — not coercive.

---

## Escalation Without Control

Escalation means **increased visibility**, not increased pressure.

When check-ins propagate across federation boundaries:

- Context is preserved  
- Authorship remains local  
- Authority does not move  
- Identity does not mutate  
- Version numbers do not change  
- Sunset is not triggered  
- Urgency is not inferred  

Federation improves shared understanding.  
It does not coordinate enforcement.

Visibility is informational, not hierarchical.

---

## Core Principle

No check-in is a command.  
No request is an obligation.  
No silence is an error.  
No escalation mutates identity.

This separation allows VDS and VLS to:

- Scale across teams and identities  
- Remain psychologically safe  
- Preserve legitimacy over time  
- Maintain structural clarity under change  

When observation is decoupled from authority,  
truth can surface without fear —  
and alignment can be chosen, not forced.
