# Value Lineage System (VLS) — Core Invariants

Status: FOUNDATIONAL  
Intent: Legitimacy Lock-In  
Scope: Any system claiming to preserve value, identity, or mission lineage over time  

This document defines the **non-negotiable invariants** of a Value Lineage System (VLS).

These invariants exist to preserve:
- legitimacy across change
- continuity of identity
- compassion in deprecation
- auditability without blame

A system that violates these invariants is not a VLS,
regardless of implementation or intent.

---

## I. Identity Is Scoped and Singular

A VLS tracks **identity**, not behavior.

- An identity represents a bounded domain of responsibility or influence
  (e.g. department, system, product, organization).
- An identity has **one scope at a time**.
- An identity may collaborate with others, but is never merged implicitly.

Fail if:
- An identity’s scope is unclear or shifting without explicit record.
- Multiple unrelated scopes are treated as one identity.

---

## II. Identity Is Not Replaced by Purpose

Purpose may change.
Identity does not.

- Purpose exists *within* identity scope.
- Purpose changes are legitimate evolutions, not identity replacement.
- Identity only changes when scope is added or removed.

Fail if:
- Purpose change overwrites identity history.
- Scope change is treated as a minor update.

---

## III. Intent Is Explicit and Durable

All intent tracked by a VLS must be explicit.

- Mission, goals, and priorities are declared, not inferred.
- Intent remains valid until consciously changed.
- Lack of update does not imply abandonment.

Fail if:
- Intent is inferred from activity or success.
- Intent disappears due to inactivity.

---

## IV. History Is Preserved, Never Erased

A VLS never rewrites history.

- Decisions, intents, identities, and transitions are append-only.
- Corrections create new records; they do not alter old ones.
- Understanding improves by accumulation, not deletion.

Fail if:
- Prior intent is reinterpreted retroactively.
- Lineage is compressed in a way that loses meaning.

---

## V. Deprecation Is Descriptive, Not Judgmental

Deprecation describes **relationship to current intent**, not quality.

- Deprecated work may still be active.
- Deprecated work is not considered failure.
- Deprecation invites reflection, not action.

Fail if:
- Deprecation is framed as error, waste, or blame.
- Deprecation triggers enforcement or urgency.

---

## VI. Abandonment Is Preserved Without Shame

Abandonment is a state, not a verdict.

- Abandoned work remains part of lineage.
- Abandonment may occur for many legitimate reasons:
  context change, constraint change, decision change.
- No moral meaning is attached.

Fail if:
- Abandoned work is hidden or deleted.
- Abandonment is framed as incompetence.

---

## VII. Federation Is Graph-Based and Non-Hierarchical

VLS federation forms a **graph of realities**, not a chain of authority.

- Each VLS represents its own valid timeline.
- No VLS is inherently authoritative over another.
- Roots, primaries, or anchors are human decisions, not system defaults.

Fail if:
- Federation assumes a central source of truth.
- Synchronization implies obedience.

---

## VIII. Federation Requires Baseline Review

No VLS trusts another by default.

- Synchronization requires explicit baseline review.
- Differences in intent, scope, or history are expected.
- Alignment is negotiated, not assumed.

Fail if:
- Lineage is merged automatically.
- Differences are treated as errors.

---

## IX. Silence Is a Meaningful State

A lack of change is not a failure.

- Stability may indicate coherence.
- Deprecated states may persist intentionally.
- Absence of updates does not imply neglect.

Fail if:
- The system pressures change due to inactivity.
- Silence is interpreted as misalignment by default.

---

## X. Observation Is Not Authority

A VLS never directs action.

- It does not recommend fixes.
- It does not escalate urgency.
- It does not enforce alignment.

It surfaces truth.
Humans decide what to do with it.

Fail if:
- The system implies required action.
- Observation becomes instruction.

---

## XI. Legitimacy Emerges From Clarity, Not Agreement

Alignment is not required for legitimacy.

- Conflicting intents may coexist.
- Divergence is acceptable and visible.
- Legitimacy comes from explicitness and preservation, not consensus.

Fail if:
- Conflict is suppressed to force coherence.
- Legitimacy is tied to conformity.

---

## Closing Statement

A Value Lineage System exists to remember faithfully.

It preserves:
- who an identity has been
- what it has cared about
- what it has consciously released

It does not optimize.
It does not govern.
It does not judge.

Its role is simple and difficult:

**to make truth durable without making anyone a villain.**
