# VDS/VLS Supportability & Instability Posture

Status: FOUNDATIONAL  
Depends On: VDS Foundation Specification, VLS Foundation Specification  
Does Not Define: incident response, root cause analysis, enforcement systems  

This document defines how caregiving behaves during degraded or unstable conditions.

It replaces the notion of “panic” with structural terminology.

---

## 1. Supportability Degradation

Supportability degradation occurs when:

- Observed conditions can no longer demonstrate support for declared decisions  
- Telemetry becomes unavailable or inconclusive  
- Stability assumptions collapse  

It is descriptive, not emotional.

---

## 2. Aggregated Check-In Cadence

During high-impact degradation:

- Repetitive check-ins may be consolidated  
- Duration and scope are summarized  
- Escalation visibility increases without duplication  

Example:

“Decision X lacks demonstrable support across 3 areas for 2 hours.”

Noise is reduced.  
Truth is preserved.

---

## 3. No Diagnostic Authority

Under instability:

VDS does not:

- Diagnose root cause  
- Recommend technical fixes  
- Override governance  
- Declare emergency states  

It reflects inability to support declared intent.

Human systems resolve incidents.

---

## 4. Suggestion Protocol

When instability exceeds declared tolerances:

VDS may suggest:

- Confirming a deployment window  
- Declaring an experiment  
- Reviewing measurement assumptions  

Suggestions are invitations — not commands.

---

## 5. Identity Continuity

Instability in one identity:

- Does not freeze unrelated identities  
- Does not suspend version evolution elsewhere  
- Does not block governance actions  

Lineage continues independently.

---

## 6. Triage Analogy

Under degradation, VDS behaves like triage:

- Stabilizes visibility  
- Prioritizes clarity  
- Compresses redundant signals  
- Preserves audit trail  

It does not perform surgery.

---

## Closing Principle

Instability is information.

Supportability degradation signals that declared intent currently lacks demonstrable backing.

The system preserves clarity under stress —  
without becoming a command center.
