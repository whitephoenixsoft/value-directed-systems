# Value Lineage System (VLS) — Usage Examples

Status: OPTIONAL (Strongly Recommended)  
Purpose: Make VLS legible through lived scenarios  
Audience: Humans evaluating whether this archetype applies to their reality  

This document illustrates how a Value Lineage System (VLS) is used in practice.
These examples are **descriptive, not prescriptive**.
They are meant to help readers *recognize their own situations*,
not to define workflows or implementations.

---

## Example 1: A Department Gains Scope

**Scenario**  
An Infrastructure department is asked to take ownership of security tooling
previously handled elsewhere.

**What Typically Happens (Without VLS)**  
- Mission statements change quietly.  
- Old priorities fade without acknowledgment.  
- Conflicts appear months later.  
- No record explains when or why the shift happened.

**With VLS**  
- Identity remains consistent.  
- Scope expansion is explicitly recorded.  
- New intent is added alongside existing intent.  
- Older goals remain visible, even if deprioritized.

**Result**  
- The department can explain *who it is now* and *how it got here*.  
- Future misalignment is diagnosable, not political.  
- History is preserved; nothing is erased for convenience.

## Example 2: A Department Loses Scope

**Scenario**  
A Product Operations group hands off deployment responsibility
to a centralized platform team.

**Key VLS Insight**  
This is an **identity change**, not a performance failure.

**With VLS**  
- Loss of scope is explicitly recorded.  
- Purpose narrows, but identity persists.  
- Work tied to the old scope becomes **deprecated**, not invalid.

**Result**  
- No one is blamed for reduced responsibilities.  
- Organizational change is documented with dignity.  
- Alignment discussions reference recorded truth, not assumption.

## Example 3: Department Split Into Two Identities

**Scenario**  
A single department splits into:
- Platform Engineering  
- Developer Experience  

**With VLS**  
- Two new identities are created.  
- Each inherits relevant parts of prior lineage.  
- Shared history is preserved, not duplicated or erased.  
- Divergence is expected and explicit.

**Result**  
- Two traceable, legitimate identities.  
- Avoids debates over “what we used to mean.”  
- Prevents rewriting history for convenience.

## Example 4: Long-Running Deprecated Work

**Scenario**  
A reporting pipeline is still running but no longer serves current mission goals.

**Without VLS**  
- Work is labeled “legacy.”  
- Engineers feel pressure to delete or defend it.  
- Knowledge erodes silently.

**With VLS**  
- Work is marked **deprecated**.  
- Original value remains documented.  
- Current misalignment is visible but non-urgent.

**Result**  
- Organization decides *when* and *how* to retire work.  
- Past contributions remain honored.  
- Deprecated does not mean useless or wrong.

---

## Example 5: Mission Redefinition Without Identity Change

**Scenario**  
A department shifts focus from “cost optimization” to “resilience and reliability.”

**With VLS**  
- Identity remains unchanged.  
- Old mission intent is preserved.  
- New mission intent is explicitly declared.  
- Conflicts between old and new goals are visible.

**Result**  
- Past work can be traced to its original intent.  
- Drift and trade-offs are intentional and auditable.  
- Narrative remains honest; no past intent is erased.

---

## Example 6: Parallel Identities With Partial Overlap

**Scenario**  
Security and Compliance teams care about auditability, but for different reasons.

**With VLS**  
- Each team retains its own identity.  
- Overlapping intent is visible, not merged.  
- Conflicts are framed as *intent differences*, not turf wars.

**Federation Note**  
- Federation preserves autonomy.  
- Shared visibility does not imply shared purpose.

**Result**  
- Coordination without forced consensus.  
- Conflict is visible, not moralized.

---

## Example 7: Temporary Identity Overlap

**Scenario**  
A project requires collaboration between Marketing and Product teams on a limited-time initiative.

**With VLS**  
- Both identities maintain separate lineages.  
- Shared goals are explicitly annotated as temporary.  
- After project completion, overlap ends, but history remains.

**Result**  
- Teams can track contributions without merging identities.  
- Temporary collaboration is visible and auditable.  
- Autonomy and lineage integrity remain intact.

---

## Closing Reflection

VLS is most valuable where change is:

- slow  
- human  
- political  
- emotionally loaded  

It does not resolve tensions.  
It makes them **visible, durable, and discussable**.

If these examples feel familiar, you are already living in a world that needs value lineage — whether you call it that or not.
