# Value-Directed Systems & Value Lineage Systems — Anti-Patterns and Disqualifiers

Status: DEFENSIVE  
Intent: Misuse Prevention  
Scope: Any system claiming to be a VDS or VLS  

This document defines **patterns that explicitly disqualify a system**
from being considered a Value-Directed System (VDS) or Value Lineage System (VLS).

These are not edge cases.
They are structural violations.

A system exhibiting these patterns may still be useful,
but it is **not** value-directed or lineage-preserving.

---

## Why This Document Exists

Every successful conceptual system is eventually pressured into misuse by:

- well-meaning engineers optimizing for efficiency
- product teams under delivery pressure
- executives seeking leverage or control
- automation-first or AI-first assumptions

This document exists to:
- prevent category collapse
- make violations obvious, not arguable
- preserve legitimacy under scale and stress

If a system violates these patterns,
the correct response is not refinement —
it is **reclassification**.

---

## I. Auto-Remediation Tied to Value or Alignment Signals

**Disqualifier**

- Value signals directly trigger system changes
- Alignment signals automatically cause remediation
- Caretaking output is wired to execution

Why this disqualifies:
- Collapses observation into action
- Converts care into control
- Removes explicit commitment

A system that auto-remediates is an optimizer.
It is not a VDS.

---

## II. Alerts Framed as Obligation or Urgency by Default

**Disqualifier**

- Signals imply required action
- Alerts are escalated as failures
- Silence is treated as negligence

Why this disqualifies:
- Introduces coercion
- Creates authority without consent
- Turns care into pressure

VDS and VLS surface information.
They do not compel response.

---

## III. Metrics Interpreted as Intent

**Disqualifier**

- Goals inferred from behavior
- Intent derived from KPIs or success patterns
- Activity treated as commitment

Why this disqualifies:
- Replaces explicit intent with hindsight
- Enables retroactive justification
- Erases ownership

Intent must be declared.
Metrics never substitute for meaning.

---

## IV. Optimization Loops Without Explicit Recommitment

**Disqualifier**

- Continuous tuning toward goals
- “Always improving” systems
- Drift justified as progress

Why this disqualifies:
- Eliminates discrete decision boundaries
- Obscures accountability
- Replaces care with momentum

Value-directed systems change deliberately or not at all.

---

## V. AI or Advisory Output With Implied Authority

**Disqualifier**

- Recommendations framed as best practice
- Suggestions treated as defaults
- AI output treated as neutral or objective

Why this disqualifies:
- Authority leaks into observation
- Humans defer instead of decide
- Legitimacy becomes probabilistic

Advice must remain clearly optional,
contextual, and non-authoritative.

---

## VI. Federation Used to Enforce Consistency

**Disqualifier**

- Central intent overrides local intent
- Synchronization implies obedience
- Global coherence enforced by structure

Why this disqualifies:
- Converts federation into hierarchy
- Breaks autonomy
- Destroys legitimacy under scale

Federation shares visibility, not control.

---

## VII. Deprecation Used as a Performance or Failure Signal

**Disqualifier**

- Deprecated work treated as waste
- Deprecation tied to incentives or punishment
- Deprecated states automatically trigger action

Why this disqualifies:
- Moralizes misalignment
- Creates blame
- Turns reflection into enforcement

Deprecation is descriptive or it is invalid.

---

## VIII. History Rewritten for Coherence or Narrative

**Disqualifier**

- Past intent reinterpreted
- Decisions reframed to fit outcomes
- Lineage compressed to look cleaner

Why this disqualifies:
- Erases truth
- Destroys auditability
- Converts lineage into propaganda

VLS preserves reality, not stories.

---

## IX. Silence Treated as Failure

**Disqualifier**

- Inactivity escalated automatically
- Stability treated as stagnation
- Systems pressured to change

Why this disqualifies:
- Introduces optimization bias
- Punishes restraint
- Breaks care

Silence is a legitimate and meaningful state.

---

## X. “Mostly VDS” or “VDS-Inspired” Claims

**Disqualifier**

- Partial adoption framed as compliance
- Violations treated as extensions
- Invariants treated as guidelines

Why this disqualifies:
- Weakens conceptual boundaries
- Enables slow drift into control systems
- Makes legitimacy subjective

VDS and VLS are categorical.
They either hold or they do not.

## Closing Warning

Value-Directed Systems and Value Lineage Systems
are easy to imitate superficially
and hard to preserve under pressure.

Most misuse does not come from malice,
but from urgency, optimization, and convenience.

This document exists so you do not have to argue.

If a system violates these patterns,
the correct response is simple:

**do not call it VDS or VLS.**
